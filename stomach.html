        <h2>What is the stomach?</h2>
        <p>The stomach is a J-shaped organ that digests food. It produces enzymes (substances that create chemical reactions) and acids (digestive juices). This mix of enzymes and digestive juices breaks down food so it can pass to your small intestine.</p>

          <p>  Your stomach is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a long tube that starts at your mouth. It runs to your anus, where stool (poop) leaves your body. The GI tract is a key part of your digestive system.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="function">
        <h2>What is the stomach’s function?</h2>
        <ul>Your stomach’s purpose is to digest food and send it to your small intestine. It has three functions:<br>
        <li>Temporarily store food.</li>
    <li>Contract and relax to mix and break down food.</li>
<li>Produce enzymes and other specialized cells to digest food.</li></ul>
    </section>
    <section id="parts">
        <h2>What are the parts of the stomach’s anatomy?</h2>
        <ul>Your stomach has five distinct sections:<br>
        <li>The cardia is the top part of your stomach. It contains the cardiac sphincter, which prevents food from traveling back up your esophagus.</li>
    <li>The fundus is a rounded section next to the cardia. It's below your diaphragm (the dome-shaped muscle that helps you breathe).</li>
    <li>The body (corpus) is the largest section of your stomach. In the body, your stomach contracts and begins to mix food.</li>
    <li>The antrum lies below the body. It holds food until your stomach is ready to send it to your small intestine.</li>
    <li>The pylorus is the bottom part of your stomach. It includes the pyloric sphincter. This ring of tissue controls when and how your stomach contents move to your small intestine.</li>
    
    </ul>
        
    </section>
    <section id="condition&disorder">
        <h2>Conditions and Disorders</h2>
        <p>Gastrointestinal diseases may affect your stomach. You may have gastrointestinal symptoms only under specific circumstances, such as getting heartburn during pregnancy. Or you may have a chronic (long-lasting) condition.</p>
<ol>Common conditions that affect your stomach include:<br>
<li>Gastric ulcers: Erosion in your stomach’s lining that can lead to pain and bleeding.</li>
    <li>Gastritis: Stomach inflammation.</li>
<li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): When stomach contents travel up to your esophagus, causing heartburn or coughing.</li>
<li>Gastroparesis: Nerve damage that affects your stomach’s muscle contractions.</li>
<li>Indigestion (dyspepsia): Discomfort, pain or burning in your upper stomach.</li>
<li>Peptic ulcer disease: Ulcers (sores) in either your stomach or the first portion of your small intestine (duodenum).</li>
<li>Stomach cancer: When cancerous cells grow uncontrollably in your stomach</li></ol>
    </section>
    <section id="care">
        <h2>Care</h2>
        <p>You can make lifestyle changes to keep your stomach and digestive system healthy. You may:</p>

<p>Drink alcohol only in moderation.
Drink at least 50 ounces of water daily, depending on your activity level and size.
Eat 25 to 35 grams of fiber daily, depending on your age and sex.
Exercise regularly.
Limit your intake of processed foods.
